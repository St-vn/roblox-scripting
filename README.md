Hello welcome to the introduction on learning how to script in Roblox. To get started, make sure to have both the output and the command bar.

Write this in the command bar and press enter
```lua
print(1)
```
It would print `1` in the output, 1 is a number. The print function would make anything that is inputed within the brackets.

You can also print mathematical operations or operations of any kind
```lua
print(1+1)
```
`1+1` which we all know is 2 would be printed in the output since it would always output an operation's result when there is one.
